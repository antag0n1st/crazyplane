================

Description:
============
  
  A paperplane is thrown in the air.Some obsticles can crash the plane but there are huge fans that help the plain to 
  go further and further.

		
Goal:
=====
  
  The goal is to set a record by flying the plane at far distance.


Scene:	
======

  The plane starts flying in some imaginary world where almost everithing is made from origami.Especialy the background.
  There will be huge metal fans that will blow the plane and help to go further. There will be obsticles of other kind 
  that will prevend the plane from reaching far distances.
	
Rules:
======

  - The plane can be manuvered by using the arrow keys , but every manuver costs some energy , especialy when going up.
  - Going down will not consume the energy.
  - Standing infront of a huge fan will increase the energy and add some speed to the plane.
  - The speed will also be decresed over time.And the plane will start falling regarding the lows of gravity
  - If the plane lands on the ground , the game is over , and the distance is calculated.
  - The plane will manuver to bypass obsticles , and collect coins.
  - Coins might be used to by some powerups.
  - If a plane crashes begind a fan , it will be sucked and shreded to pices.What a fabulous death :)
  - there might be some powerups that will break the basic rules of the game , just to make it more fun.
	
Leveling:
=========

 - the frequency of fans will not decrease , the player should have a fair amout of energy to make manuvers
 - the number of obsticles will increase for sure , forceing the player into more manuvers
