Paper Plane Game
================

Description:
============
  
  A paperplane is thrown in the air.Some obsticles can crash the plane but there are huge fans that help the plain to 
  go further and further.

		
Goal:
=====
  
  The goal is to set a record by flying the plane at far distance.


Scene:	
======

  The plane starts flying in some imaginary world where almost everithing is made from origami.Especialy the background.
  There will be huge metal fans that will blow the plane and help to go further. There will be obsticles of other kind 
  that will prevend the plane from reaching far distances.
	
Rules:
======

  - The plane can be manuvered by using the arrow keys , but every manuver costs some energy , especialy when going up.
  - Going down will not consume the energy.
  - Standing infront of a huge fan will increase the energy and add some speed to the plane.
  - The speed will also be decresed over time.And the plane will start falling regarding the lows of gravity
  - If the plane lands on the ground , the game is over , and the distance is calculated.
  - The plane will manuver to bypass obsticles , and collect coins.
  - Coins might be used to by some powerups.
  - If a plane crashes begind a fan , it will be sucked and shreded to pices.What a fabulous death :)
  - there might be some powerups that will break the basic rules of the game , just to make it more fun.
	
Leveling:
=========

 - the frequency of fans will not decrease , the player should have a fair amout of energy to make manuvers
 - the number of obsticles will increase for sure , forceing the player into more manuvers
 



Power Ups:
=========

	All power ups , will be displayed as progress bars.

	- Level up 
			- Collect resource 1 to power up , you need more of this resource to fill the progress bar.
			Once the progress bar is full , it will reset , and it will enter next level. 
			(Next level will need more resources)
			- It will increase the base speed of the plane on every level.
			
	- Energy Up
			- Collect resource 2 , if the progress bar is full no energy will be added.
			- It will increase the Energy bar , needed to navigate the plane.	
	
	- Magnet
			- Collect resource 3 to fill the progress bar for this power up , the power up will
			automatically take place and the progress bar will reset. The amount of resources 
			needed to fill this progress bar 
			will be the same in every level, the price will not increase.
			- It will automatically collect near by resources
			
	- Rocket
			- Collect resource 4 , otherwise it will behave just like the Magnet Power up.
			- It will be easy to navigate , and it will not consume the energy. The frequency of some 
			resources might increase.
